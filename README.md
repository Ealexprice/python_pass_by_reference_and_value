## Passing by Reference and by Value
The Python code demonstrates the difference between pass by value and pass by reference, but is conceptually applicable to any language. The presentation explains these concepts in general, with examples in Python. Read the presentation first, then study the code. There are two copies of the code, one with comments to explain the code, and one with no comments for easier reading of the code.
